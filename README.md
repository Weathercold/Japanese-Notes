# Japanese-Notes

Repository containing my personal notes for learning Japanese, tracking my language learning progress. As the notes are written in Chinese, they most likely won't be useful to you.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to take notes and manage the repository with [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git). I don't use most of the features of Obsidian-flavoured markdown, such as wikilink and highlight, to make the  notes readable on GitHub and other markdown editors.
